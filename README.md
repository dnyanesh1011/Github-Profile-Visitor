# 🚀 **GitHub Profile Visitor Automation** 🤖

Welcome to **GitHub Profile Visitor Automation**, a fun and experimental Python project that automates visiting and refreshing your GitHub profile to increase profile visit counts. 🎯

🔧 **What does it do?**
This project uses **Selenium** to automate visiting and refreshing your GitHub profile 2000 times! It's a great way to test and observe how GitHub tracks profile visits. 💻

### 🧩 **How It Works**:
1. The script **visits** your GitHub profile.
2. Waits for the page to load, then **refreshes** the page.
3. Repeats the process 2000 times, simulating traffic to your profile. 🔄

### ⚡ **Why Use It?**
- **Test GitHub's traffic tracking**: Want to see how your GitHub profile’s visit counter increases? This is for you!
- **Simple Automation**: A quick way to simulate profile visits without manual refreshing.
- **Boost your profile count**: Increase your visit count to see how fast it updates with each refresh. 📈
