# 🚀 **GitHub Profile Visitor Automation** 🤖

Welcome to **GitHub Profile Visitor Automation**, a fun and experimental Python project that automates visiting and refreshing your GitHub profile to increase profile visit counts. 🎯

🔧 **What does it do?**
This project uses **Selenium** to automate visiting and refreshing your GitHub profile **2000 times**! It's a great way to test and observe how GitHub tracks profile visits. 💻

### 🧩 **How It Works**:
1. The script **visits** your GitHub profile.
2. Waits for the page to load, then **refreshes** the page.
3. Repeats the process 2000 times, simulating traffic to your profile. 🔄

### ⚡ **Why Use It?**
- **Test GitHub's traffic tracking**: Want to see how your GitHub profile’s visit counter increases? This is for you!
- **Simple Automation**: A quick way to simulate profile visits without manual refreshing.
- **Boost your profile count**: Increase your visit count to see how fast it updates with each refresh. 📈

## 📋 **Prerequisites**:
Before you run the script, ensure you have the following setup:

1. **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. If not, [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Selenium**: This script uses the Selenium package to automate the browser. You need to install it using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. **ChromeDriver**: This project uses **ChromeDriver** to interact with the Google Chrome browser. It must be compatible with the version of Chrome installed on your system.

   - **Download ChromeDriver**: Visit the official [ChromeDriver download page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) and download the version matching your Chrome version.
   - **How to check Chrome version**:
     - Open Chrome.
     - In the top-right corner, click the three dots menu > **Help** > **About Google Chrome**.
     - Download the corresponding ChromeDriver version from the link above.
   
4. **IDE Setup**: It's assumed that you have an IDE (like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any Python-supported IDE) set up to run Python scripts.
